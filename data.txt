S TAT E M E N T
As a dedicated and ambitious second-year CyberSecurity and Forensics undergraduate student at Edinburgh 
Napier University, I possess a strong interest in programming, ethical hacking, reverse engineering and web 
development. I am highly motivated to expand my knowledge in the cyberspace through various side projects 
and am currently seeking a internship opportunity to utilise my technical and soft skills to support a company's 
mission. I am well-prepared for an internship and eager to take the next step in my career.
